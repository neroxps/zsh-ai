## Why zsh-ai?

**🪶 Featherweight** - A single 5KB shell script. No Python, no Node.js, etc.

**🚀 Lightning Fast** - Starts instantly with your shell.

**🎯 Dead Simple** - Just type `# what you want to do` and press Enter. That's it.

**🔒 Privacy First** - Bring your own API keys. Your commands stay local, API calls only when you trigger them.

**🛠️ Zero Dependencies** - Optionally `jq` for reliability.

```bash
$ # find all large files modified this week
$ find . -type f -size +50M -mtime -7

$ # kill process using port 3000  
$ lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9

$ # compress images in current directory

Just type what you want in plain English, get the exact command you need.

## Prerequisites

 ✅ zsh 5.0+ (you probably already have this)
- ✅ An [Anthropic API key](https://console.anthropic.com/account/keys) (one-time setup)
- ✅ `curl` (already on macOS/Linux)
- ➕ `jq` (optional, for better reliability)
